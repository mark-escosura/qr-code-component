## Overview

A QR code is a 2-D barcode that can be digitally read by smartphones. QR codes contain information just like barcodes. They can be used to make a call, send a message or email, or even open a website.

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

I learned how to use the media css property to include a block of CSS properties only if a certain condition is true.

```css
@media screen and (max-width: 758px) {
  .container {
    margin: 30px;
  }
}
```

**Code snippet above is showing that if the browser window is 758px or smaller, the elements with the container class will have a margin of 30px.**

### Continued development

I plan on focusing more on responsive styling. I wanna dive deep more into media queries and setting different breakpoints along with the necessary style changes that needs to be done on those certain screen sizes.
